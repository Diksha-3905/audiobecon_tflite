# AudioBecon TFLite

> Real-time **audio beacon detection** powered by **TensorFlow Lite** & **Flutter**, built to run **everywhere** – Android, iOS, Web, Windows, macOS, and Linux.

---

## 🌟 About the Project
**AudioBecon TFLite** is a cross-platform application that uses **on-device machine learning** to detect and process audio signals. By integrating **TensorFlow Lite models** with a **Flutter frontend** and native code (C++, Swift), the project provides a lightweight, fast, and privacy-friendly way to process sounds without depending on the cloud.

## ✨ Features
- 🔊 **Audio Beacon Detection** – Identify and respond to specific audio signals.
- 📱 **Cross-Platform** – Works on Android, iOS, Web, Windows, macOS, and Linux.
- ⚡ **On-Device Inference** – Powered by TensorFlow Lite for fast & private audio ML.
- 🖥️ **Flutter UI** – Beautiful and portable interface.
- 🛠️ **Native Performance** – C++ and Swift layers for optimized audio processing.
- 🔄 **Multiple Inference Frameworks** – Support for TFLite, ONNX Runtime, Core ML, and more.

### Performance Optimization Exploration (October 2025)

We've completed a comprehensive exploration of alternative inference frameworks! Check out:
- 📊 [Issue #2 Resolution Summary](ISSUE_2_RESOLUTION.md) - Quick overview
- 📚 [Complete Documentation](docs/) - Detailed guides and benchmarks


We've conducted comprehensive research on inference framework alternatives to ensure optimal performance:

### Documentation
- **[Performance Exploration Summary](docs/PERFORMANCE_EXPLORATION_SUMMARY.md)** - Complete analysis of TFLite alternatives
- **[Framework Comparison](docs/INFERENCE_ALTERNATIVES_COMPARISON.md)** - Detailed comparison of inference frameworks
- **[Benchmark Results](docs/BENCHMARK_RESULTS.md)** - Performance benchmarks and methodology
- **[Recommendations](docs/RECOMMENDATIONS.md)** - Strategic recommendations for framework selection
- **[Quick Start Optimization](docs/QUICK_START_OPTIMIZATION.md)** - Immediate performance improvements
- **[Implementation Guide](docs/IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md)** - Step-by-step implementation guides
- **[Migration Guide](docs/MIGRATION_GUIDE.md)** - How to switch between frameworks

### Key Findings
- ✅ **TFLite remains competitive** with proper optimization (2-3x faster with GPU/NNAPI delegates)
- ✅ **ONNX Runtime** offers 20-40% better performance in some scenarios
- ✅ **Core ML** provides best performance on iOS (50-100% faster)
- ✅ **Hybrid approach** recommended for maximum flexibility

### Quick Wins
1. Enable GPU/NNAPI/Metal delegates → **2-3x faster**
2. Implement INT8 quantization → **70% smaller model**
3. Optimize audio preprocessing → **30% less memory**

See [Quick Start Optimization Guide](docs/QUICK_START_OPTIMIZATION.md) for immediate improvements.
