# AudioBecon TFLite  

> Real-time **audio beacon detection** powered by **TensorFlow Lite** & **Flutter**, built to run **everywhere** – Android, iOS, Web, Windows, macOS, and Linux.  

---

## 🌟 About the Project  
**AudioBecon TFLite** is a cross-platform application that uses **on-device machine learning** to detect and process audio signals. By integrating **TensorFlow Lite models** with a **Flutter frontend** and native code (C++, Swift), the project provides a lightweight, fast, and privacy-friendly way to process sounds without depending on the cloud.

## ✨ Features  
- 🔊 **Audio Beacon Detection** – Identify and respond to specific audio signals.  
- 📱 **Cross-Platform** – Works on Android, iOS, Web, Windows, macOS, and Linux.  
- ⚡ **On-Device Inference** – Powered by TensorFlow Lite for fast & private audio ML.  
- 🖥️ **Flutter UI** – Beautiful and portable interface.  
- 🛠️ **Native Performance** – C++ and Swift layers for optimized audio processing.
